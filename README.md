# House_Rent_Prediction_Waterloo

Predicting the rent of properties based on their location and facilities in Waterloo

Waterloo is a student driven city and it is difficult to find a good accomodation at a reasonable rate.
This project aims at finding the factors that impacts the most on deciding the rent of a given house and at the same time it presents opportunities for the rental property dealers to create deals that attracts more students and increases their sales.
