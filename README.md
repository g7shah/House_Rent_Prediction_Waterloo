# House_Rent_Prediction_Waterloo

Predicting the rent of properties based on their location and facilities in Waterloo

Waterloo is a student driven city and it is difficult to find a good accomodation at a reasonable rate.
This project aims at finding the factors that impacts the most on deciding the rent of a given house and at the same time it presents opportunities for the rental property dealers to create offers that attracts more students and increases their sales.

In the end, business insights were presented after a thorough analysis of the data.

Project highlights:
Data was collected by sending google created form to friends but it turned out to be ineffective as only 60 data points were collected. So, I did web scraping using SCRAPY tool in python on the rental property websites and collected more detailed data.
After cleaning and visualizing the data, machine learning algorithms were applied for regression and model evaluation was done which is presented in house.pdf
Clustering and Apriori analysis was further carried out which can be observed in, well as the name suggests, Clustering&Apriori.pdf

Report-HousingRentalPrediction is the final report comprising all the coding components with business insights.

## TL;DR - Go through Report-HousingRentalPrediction.pdf for entire workflow of the project!
